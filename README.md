Principles of Component Building:
- To render a list in JSX, we use the ‘array.map()’ method. When mapping items, each item must have a unique key, which can be a string or a number
- We can pass data and functions to a component using props. Functions are used to notify the parent (consumer) of a component about certain events that occur in the child component,
  such as an item being clicked or selected.
